# Final Project for Data Visualization

## Getting Started

Run the following commands to create an empty directories for the project.

```
mkdir -p csv
mkdir -p pickle
```

In order to run the project, you need a few csv files.

- Crime data 2001 to present : https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2?fbclid=IwAR3n_LGYUaQnhq-siMRNU5eJYHti-oVfIoQg8CLckkWyQ9j0ztVRBRWJkxs
- Police stations : https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Police-Stations/z8bn-74gv
- Socioeconomic : https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2?fbclid=IwAR0SrKYTiVC03m0M8XrmXeGIE7RneEy2LzMU4XWqbzFANuvTogJsgF6wusA
- Grocery stores : https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Grocery-Stores-2013/53t8-wyrc
- Street lights out : https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests-Street-Lights-One-Out-Histori/3aav-uy2v?fbclid=IwAR0AE0XNtK19JUM5rEqlCo-EFUOCX6dV8f2KQOxdW9g77zk_i8NPeNI2icw

Download all csv and put them in `csv` directory. Then, the files should look like this.

```sh
.
├── README.md
├── crime_data.ipynb
├── csv
│   ├── 311_Service_Requests_-_Street_Lights_-_One_Out_-_Historical.csv
│   ├── Census_Data_-_Selected_socioeconomic_indicators_in_Chicago__2008___2012.csv
│   ├── Crimes_-_2001_to_present.csv
│   ├── Grocery_Stores_-_2013.csv
│   └── Police_Stations.csv
├── pickle
│   └── street_light_out_count.pickle # optional
└── street_light.py
```

Please noted that `pickle/street_light_out_count.pickle` is not necessary and can be generated by running `street_light.py`. However, it might take a few hours to process. That's why I have attached the pre-processed data, named `pickle/street_light_out_count.pickle`
